### To use
1. clone this repo
2. cd ~/dotfiles (this repo)
3. `stow vim` (and any other folder)

### Stow
GNU Stow is a symlink manager. I realized instead of just using installers made popular by dotfiles repo, I could use something built in and `stow` is perfect for it.

### Installing `stow`
For MacOS
1. `brew install stow`

For Debian/Ubuntu
1. `sudo apt install stow`
